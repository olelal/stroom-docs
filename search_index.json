you'd like to jump straight in then see the Quick Start Guide, alternatively you can find the full documentation here.

It is scalable - just add more CPUs / servers for greater throughput. It is suitable for processing high volume data such as system logs, to provide valuable insights into IT performance and usage.\nStroom provides a number of powerful capabilities:\n\nData ingest. Receive and store large volumes of data such as native format logs. Ingested data is always available in its raw form.\nData transformation pipelines. Create sequences of XSL and text operations, in order to normalise or export data in any format. It is possible to enrich data using lookups and reference data.\nIntegrated transformation development. Easily add new data formats and debug the transformations if they don't work as expected.\nScalable Search. Create multiple indexes with different retention periods. These can be sharded across your cluster.\nStatistics. Record counts or values of items over time, providing answers to questions such as \"how many times has a specific machine provided data in the last hour/day/month?\"\nDashboards. Run queries against your indexes or statistics and view the results within custom visualisations.\n\nBenefits\nSystem event data can come from many kinds of technology, this makes it highly heterogeneous with many different formats in use. As technologies are invented, new event types and log formats must be understood and processed correctly. Technology changes so rapidly that the auditing team risks being left behind.\nStroom is designed to offer a way to mitigate this risk, and has matured into an application that scales well to billions of events a day - sufficient to ingest and process the system events generated by the IT of a large organisation.\nThe person who introduces a new log format is probably best placed to describe it. Stroom provides these experts with tools that make it easy to normalise data, essentially crowdsourcing the problem. An organisation can ask their employees to configure Stroom whenever they introduce a new technology, and have confidence that it will be able to be properly audited.\nArchitecture\nStroom is a Java web application that runs on Apache Tomcat, with Apache Lucene indexes over a compressed data store. It uses a MySQL RDBMS to persist application configuration and metadata. \nCurrently Stroom has only been tested with Google Chrome. For this reason some functionality may not work correctly in other browsers. Now that Stroom is an open source project, support for other browsers will be improved.\nThere are several optional components for different use cases:\n\nStroom Proxy - An application that receives and forwards data to Stroom.\nStroom Agent - An application that extracts data from sources. \nLogging Events XML Schema - A common language for describing audit events.\nContent Packs - Transformation packages for standard log formats (e.g. Windows, Linux) into Logging Events XML.\n\nScreenshots\nSome screenshots of the application can be seen here.\nState of the Project\nStroom has recently undergone a significant code refactor and change to its security model. As a result v5.0.0, the forthcoming version, is currently in beta and is still being tested. We would recommend waiting for a stable release before deploying into a production environment.\nFuture\nAlthough Stroom is a mature product it is receiving more active development effort than ever. Work is underway to evolve the existing architecture and add new features:\n\nA rule engine for notifying analysts about particular event scenarios\nScalable temporal state storage that could be used by rules or dashboards\nNew visualisations to improve analysis\nA modularised, micro-service-based architecture\nFurther integration with the Hadoop ecosystem\n\n"},"screenshots.html":{"url":"screenshots.html","title":"Screenshots","keywords":"","body":"Screenshots\nBrowse stored data\n\nCreate pipelines to transform data\n\nBrowse XML schemas used to validate data\n\nCreate custom indexes to search the data\n\nCreate custom visualisations for your data by directly editing script\n\nCreate dashboards that incorporate tables and other visualisations for your data\n\n"},"quick-start-guide/quick-start.html":{"url":"quick-start-guide/quick-start.html","title":"Quick-start guide","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Quick-Start Tutorial\nIn this quick-start guide you will learn how to use Stroom to get from this CSV, which looks like this:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application\n1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap\n2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex\n...\nTo this XML:\n\n\n   \n      1\n      10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06\n      159.161.108.105\n      217.151.32.69\n      Tres-Zap\n   \n   \n      2\n      633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a\n      210.14.34.58\n      133.136.48.23\n      Sub-Ex\n   \n  ...\n\nYou will go from a clean vanilla Stroom to having a simple pipeline that takes in CSV data and outputs that data transformed into XML. Stroom is a generic and powerful tool for ingesting and processing data: it's flexible because it's generic so if you do want to start processing data we would recommend you follow this tutorial otherwise you'll find yourself struggling.\nWe're going to do the following:\n\nGet and run Stroom\nDo some quick and easy but necessary config\nGet some data into Stroom\nSet up a pipeline\n\nAll the things we create here are available as a content pack, so if you just wanted to see it running you could get there quite easily.\n\nNote: The CSV data used in mock_stroom_data.csv (linked to above) is randomly generated and any association with any real world IP address or name is entirely coincidental.\n\nGetting and Running Stroom\nThere are several options to get Stroom running and by far the quickest and easiest is to use Docker. If you're new to Docker then you might want to follow their getting started guide first. Otherwise you can follow our quick guide.\nIf you're really interested here are your full options for running Stroom:\n\nRun using a Docker Hub image (recommended)\nRun using a release\nFrom source you can:\nBuild and run from IntelliJ\nBuild and run using Docker\n\n\n\nBasic configuration\nEnable processing of data streams\nAutomatic processing isn't enabled by default: you might first want to check other settings (for example  nodes, properties, and volumes). So we need to enable Stream Processing. This is in Tools -> Jobs menu::\n\nNext we need to enable Stream Processor jobs:\n\nBelow the list of jobs is the properties pane. The Stream Processor's properties show the list of nodes. You should have one. You'll need to enable it by scrolling right:\n\nGetting data into Stroom\nCreate the feed\nIn real life you might configure Stroom to watch for new files in a directory. In this tutorial we'll be uploading data but the result will be the same: raw event data sitting on a feed.\nA lot of Stroom's functionality is available through right-click context menus. If you right-click  System in the tree you can create new things. Create a new folder and call it something like Stroom 101:\n\nRight-click again and create a feed. The name needs to be capitalised, e.g. CSV_IN.\n\n\nThis will open a new tab for the feed. We want to add some data to the feed so click on Data at the top of the tab. \n\n\nThen click the green up arrow () to get the file upload dialog.\n\nWe're going to be putting in unprocessed events, known in Stroom as raw events. That's the type of stream this feed will contain, so that's the Stream Type you need to select. \n\n\n\n\nDownload this file, then click choose file from the dialog, select the file, and then ok everything until you're back at the feed.\n\nThat's it, there's now data in Stroom. You should be able to see it in the data table (you might need to click the refresh (button):\n\nNow you can do all sorts of things with the data: transform it, visualise it, index it. It's Pipelines that allow all these things to happen.\nCreate a pipeline\nPipelines control how data is processed in Stroom. Typically you're going to want to do a lot of the same stuff for every pipeline, i.e. similar transformations, indexing, writing out data. You can actually create a template pipeline and inherit from it, tweaking what you need to for this or that feed. We're not doing that now because we want to show how to create one from scratch.\n\n\nCreate a pipeline by right-clicking our Stroom 101 folder. Call it something like CSV to XML pipeline.\nSelect Structure from the top of the new tab. This is the most important view for the pipeline because it shows what will actually happen on the pipeline.\nCheck Advanced Mode so that we can actually edit things.\n\n\nWe already have a Source element. Unlike most other pipeline elements this isn't something we need to configure. It's just there to show the starting point. Data gets into the pipeline via other means - we'll describe this in detail later.\nAdd a data splitter\nData splitters are powerful, and a lot we can say about them. Here we're just going to make a basic one.\nCreate a CSV splitter\nWe have CSV in the following form:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application\n1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap\n2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex\nTo process this we need to know if there's a header row, and what the delimiters are. This is a job for a Data Splitter. \nThe splitter is actually a type of Text Converter, so lets create one of those:\n\nCall it something like CSV splitter. In the new tab you need to tell the Text Converter that it'll be a Data Splitter:\n\nNow go to the Conversion tab. What you need to put in here is specific to the built-in Data Splitter functionality, so I'm just going to tell you what you're going to need:\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can see that it uses the data-splitter-v3.0.1.xsd that we imported earlier. Save it by clicking the save icon ().\nSo we now have a configured, re-usable data splitter for CSV files that have headers. We need to add this to our pipeline as a filter, so head back to the pipeline's Structure section and add a DSParser, as below. Call it something like CSV splitter filter:\n\nNow we have a pipeline that looks like this:\n\nClick on the CSV splitter filter element and the pane below will show it's properties. We need to tell it to use our newly created CSV splitter. Double click the textConverter property and change Value to the actual CSV splitter:\n\nTest the csv splitter\nSo now we have CSV data in Stroom and a pipeline that is configured to process CSV data. We've done a fair few things so far and are we sure the pipeline is correctly configured? We can do some debugging and find out.\nIn Stroom you can step through you records and see what the output is at each stage. It's easy to start doing this. The first thing to do is to open your CSV_FEED feed, then click the big blue stepping button at the bottom right:\n\nYou'll be asked to select a pipeline:\n\nNow you get a view that's similar to your feed view, except it also shows the pipeline:\n\nIt also has stepping controls. Click the green step forward icon (). You should see something like this:\n\nGreat! If you don't see this then there's something wrong. Click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code and hopefully some errors. Some issues might be: did you remember to import the data splitter schema into Stroom? Did you remember to confgure the Text Converter to be a Data Splitter? \nIf everything went fine then click the step forward button a few more times and you'll see the yellow selection move down as you process each row.\nWhat we actually want to see is the output from the Text Converter, so click on CSV splitter filter. You'll see the conversion code we entered earlier and below two panes, one containing the CSV and one containing the split-up text, in XML form:\n\nSo here we have some XML in a basic format we call the records format. You can see the schema for records in the XML schemas folder.\nAdd XSLT to transform records format XML into something else\nCreate the XSLT filter\nThis process is very similar to creating the CSV splitter: \n\nCreate the XSLT filter\nAdd it to the pipeline \nStep through to make sure it's doing what we expect\n\nCreate the XSLT filter, calling it something like XSLT:\n\nOn the new tab click on XSLT. This is another big text field but this one accepts XSLT. This one will be very basic and just takes the split up data and puts it into fields. The XSLT for this is below but if you'd like to tinker then go ahead.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMake sure you save it.\nGo back to the Structure section of the pipeline and add an XSLTFilter element. Call it something like XSLT filter. \n\nSelect the XSLT filter and configure it to use the actual XSLT you just created by double-clicking xslt in the properties:\n\nIn the dialog make sure the value is the XSLT filter. Save the pipeline.\nTest the XSLT filter\nWe're going to test this in the same way we tested the CSV splitter, by clicking the big blue button on the feed. Click the step forward button () a few times to make sure it's working then click on the XSLT element. This time you should see the XSLT filter there too, as well as the basic XML being transformed into more useful XML:\n\nFantastic! Data converted! Well done if you've got this far. Really, there are lots of steps and things that could go wrong and you've persevered. There's a few more things to get this pipeline ready for doing this task for real. We need to get this data to a destination.\nOutputting the transformed data\nCreate the XML writer\nWhat's an XML Writer and why do you need one? The XSLT filter doesn't actually write XML but instead just passes XML events from one filter to another. In order to write XML out you need an XML writer. You don't need to create one outside the pipeline (in the way you did with the CSV splitter and the XSLT filter). An XML writer is just added to the pipeline like this:\n\nThat's it, no other configuration necessary.\nCreate the destination\nWe need to do something with the serialised XML. We'll write it to a stream. To do this we create a stream appender:\n\nUnlike the Source element this element needs to be configured. We need to configure two things: the streamType and the destination feed. \nSetting the feed\nWe'll send the output to the CSV_FEED - all data associated with this feed will be in the same place. To do that we edit the feed property and set it to CSV_FEED:\n\nWe also need to edit the streamType property:We set the streamType to Events:\n\n\nThat's it! Our pipeline is configured! \nTest the destination\nWe can test the XML writer and the streamAppender using the same stepping feature. Make sure you've saved the pipeline and set a new stepping session running. If you click on the stream appender you'll see something like this:\n\nSet the pipeline running\nObviously you don't want to step through your data one by one. This all needs automation, and this is what Processors are for. The processor works in the background to take any unprocessed data from a feed and put it through a pipeline. So far everything on our EXAMPLE_IN feed is unprocessed. \nCreate a processor\nProcessors are created from the Processors section of the pipeline:\n\nClick the add button  and configure the huge dialog. You only need to set the incoming feed and the stream types:\n(\nNow you'll see a very wide table looking something like this:\n\nThis shows two things:\n\nThe processor for the pipeline\nThe filter that determines what data is passed to the processor\n\nIf you scroll all the way over to the right you'll see the Enabled checkbox:\n\nCheck enabled for the processor and the filter you've just created. This is it, everything we've done is about to start working on its own, just like it would in a real configuration.\nIf you keep refreshing this table it will show you the processing status which should change after a few seconds to show that the data you have uploaded is being or has been processed. Once this has happened you should be able to open the destination feed and see the output data (or errors if there were any).\n\nYou can see that there are the Raw Events and the processed Events. If you click on the Events then you can see all the XML that we've produced.\nTroubleshooting\nIf nothing happens you might need to enable stream processing. This was explained earlier.\n"},"install-guide/stroom-app-install.html":{"url":"install-guide/stroom-app-install.html","title":"Installing Stroom","keywords":"","body":"Stroom Install\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall file 'stroom-app-distribution-X-Y-Z-bin.zip'.

There are three ways that a task can be executed:\n\nScheduled tasks execute periodically according to a cron schedule. These include tasks such as cleaning the file system where Stroom only needs to perform this action once a day and can do so overnight.\nFrequency controlled tasks are executed every X seconds, minutes, hours etc. Most of the tasks that execute with a given frequency are status checking tasks that perform a short lived action fairly frequently.\nDistributed tasks are only applicable to stream processing with a pipeline.

The code for the clients is in the stroom-clients repository (TODO link).\nUNIX (using curl)\nCurl is a standard unix tool to send data to or from a server. In the following examples -H is used to specify the header arguments required by Stroom, see Header Arguments.\nNotes:\n\nThe @ character must be used in front of the file being posted. If it is not then curl will post the file name instead of it's contents.\nThe --data-binary argument must always be used even for text formats, in order to prevent data corruption by curl stripping out newlines.\n\nExample HTTPS post without authentication:\ncurl -k --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nIn the above example -k is required to stop curl from authenticating the server. The next example must be used to supply the necessary CA to authenticate the server if this is required.\nExample HTTPS With 1 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA. The CA is provided to curl using the '--cacert root_ca.crt' parameter.\nFor step by step instructions for creating, configuring and testing the PKI authentication, see the SSL Guide\nExample HTTPS With 2 way SSL authentication:\ncurl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @file.dat \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n        -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n        -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n        -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nThe above example both verifies that the certificate presented by Stroom is signed by the CA and also provides a certificate to authenticate itself with Stroom. The data provider provides a certificate using the '--cert example.pem' parameter.\nIf your input file is not compressed you should compress it as follows:\ngzip -c uncompressedfile.dat | curl --cert example.pem --cacert root_ca.crt --data-binary @- \"https:///stroom/datafeed\"\n            -H \"Feed:EXAMPLE_FEED\"\n            -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\"\n            -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n            -H \"Compression:Gzip\"\n\nWhen delivering data from a RHEL4 host, an additional header argument must be added to specify the FQDN of the host:\n-H \"Hostname:host.being.audited\"\n\nThe hostname being sent as a header argument may be resolved upon execution using the command hostname -f.\nSSL Notes\nTo create a .pem format key simply append the private key and certifcate.\ncat .key >> .pem\ncat .crt >> .pem\n\nTo remove the pass phrase from a openssl private key use.\nopenssl rsa -in server.key -out server-clear.key\n\nThe send-logs.sh script assumes the period start and end times are embedded in the file name (e.g. log_2010-01-01T12:00:00.000Z_2010-01-02T12:00:00.000Z.log).  The certificates will need to be added to the script as above.\nWindows\nUsing wget\nThere is a version of wget for windows\n\nUse --post-file argument to supply the data\nUse --certificate and --certificate-type arguments to specify your client certificate\nUse --header argument to inform Stroom which feed and environment your data relates to\n\nUsing curl\nThere is a version of curl for Windows\nNote: We haven't tried using this so if anybody would like to have a go and provide documentation for this section please do.\nUsing VBScript\nextract-data.vbs uses wevtutil.exe to extract Security event information from the windows event log.  This script has been tested on Windows 2008.\nThis script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes).  The first time the script is run it stores the current time in UTC format in the registry.  Subsequent calls then extract event information from the last run time to the new current time.  The events are stored in a zip file with the period dates embedded.\nThe script requires a working directory used as a buffer for the zip files.  This can be set at the start of the script otherwise it will default to the working directory.\nThe send-data.vbs script is designed to run periodically (say every 10 minutes). The script will scan for zip files and send them to Stroom.\nThe script details several parameters that require setting per environment. Among these are the working directory that the zip files are stored in, the feed name and the URL of Stroom.\nSSL\nTo send data over SSL (https) you must import a client certificate in p12 format into windows.To convert a certificate (.crt) and private key (.key) into a p12 format use the following command:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in .crt -inkey .key -out .p12 -name \"\"\n\nOnce in p12 format use the windows certificate wizard to import the public private key.\nThe send-data-tree.vbs script works through a directory for different feed types.  \nUsing Java\nThe stroom-java-client provides an example Java client that can:\n\nRead a zip, gzip or uncompressed an input file.\nPerform a HTTP post of data with zip, gzip or uncompressed compression.\nPass down arguments on the command line as HTTP request arguments.\nSupports HTTP and HTTPS with 1 or 2 way authentication.\n\n(N.B. arguments must be in lower case).\nTo use the example client first compile the Java code:\njavac DataFeedClient.java\n\nExample HTTP Post:\njava -classpath .

This can be achieved in one of the following ways:\n\nPlacing MySQL and the application behind a firewall\nSecuring communication through the use of iptables\nMaking MySQL and the application communicate over SSL (see here for instructions)\n\nThe above options are not mutually exclusive and may be combined to better secure communication.\nApplication\nNode to node communication\nIn a multi node Stroom deployment each node communicates with the master node. This can be configured securely in one of several ways:\n\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8080 - Secured by being behind a firewall or using iptables\nDirect communication to Tomcat on port 8443 - Secured using SSL and certificates\nRemoval of Tomcat connectors other than AJP and configuration of Apache to communicate on port 443 using SSL and certificates\n\nApplication to Stroom Proxy Communication\nThe application can be configured to share some information with Stroom Proxy so that Stroom Proxy can decide whether or not to accept data for certain feeds based on the existence of the feed or it's reject/accept status. The amount of information shared between the application and the proxy is minimal but could be used to discover what feeds are present within the system. Securing this communication is harder as both the application and the proxy will not typically reside behind the same firewall. Despite this communication can still be performed over SSL thus protecting this potential attack vector.\nServlets\nThere are several servlets in Stroom that are accessible by certain URLs. Considerations should be made about what URLs are made available via Apache and who can access them. The servlets, path and function are described below:\n\n\n\nServlet\nPath\nFunction\nRisk\n\n\n\n\nDataFeed\n/datafeed or /datafeed/*\nUsed to receive data\nPossible denial of service attack by posting too much data/noise\n\n\nRemoteFeedService\n/remoting/remotefeedservice.rpc\nUsed by proxy to ask application about feed status (described in previous section)\nPossible to systematically discover which feeds are available. Communication with this service should be secured over SSL dicussed above\n\n\nDynamicCSSServlet\n/stroom/dynamic.css\nServes dynamic CSS based on theme configuration\nLow risk as no important data is made available by this servlet\n\n\nDispatchService\n/stroom/dispatch.rpc\nService for UI and server communication\nAll backend services accessed by this umbrella service are secured appropriately by the application\n\n\nImportFileServlet\n/stroom/importfile.rpc\nUsed during configuration upload\nUsers must be authenticated and have appropriate permissions to import configuration\n\n\nScriptServlet\n/stroom/script\nServes user defined visualisation scripts to the UI\nThe visualisation script is considered to be part of the application just as the CSS so is not secured\n\n\nClusterCallService\n/clustercall.rpc\nUsed for node to node communication as dicussed above\nCommunication must be secured as discussed above\n\n\nExportConfig\n/export/*\nServlet used to export configuration data\nServlet access must be restricted with Apache to prevent configuration data being made available to unauthenticated users\n\n\nStatus\n/status\nShows the application status including volume usage\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see the application status\n\n\nEcho\n/echo\nBlock GZIP data posted to the echo servlet is sent back uncompressed. This is a utility servlet for decompression of external data\nURL should be secured or not made available\n\n\nDebug\n/debug\nServlet for echoing HTTP header arguments including certificate details\nShould be secured in production environments\n\n\nSessionList\n/sessionList\nLists the logged in users\nNeeds to be secured so that only appropriate users can see who is logged in\n\n\nSessionResourceStore\n/resourcestore/*\nUsed to create, download and delete temporary files liked to a users session such as data for export\nThis is secured by using the users session and requiring authentication\n\n\n\nHDFS\nStroom comes with a filter that allows you to write data to HDFS. It should be noted that communication with HDFS is currently not secure when using this filter.\nContent\nIt may be possible for a user to write XSLT, Data Splitter or other content that may expose data that we do not wish to or to cause the application some harm. At present processing operations are not isolated processes and so it is easy to cripple processing performance with a badly written translation whether written accidentally or on purpose. To mitigate this risk it is recommended that users that are given permission to create XSLT, Data Splitter and Pipeline configurations are trusted to do so.\nVisualisations can be completely customised with javascript. The javascript that is added is executed in a clients browser potentially opening up the possibility of XSS attacks, an attack on the application to access data that a user shouldn't be able to access, an attack to destroy data or simply failure/incorrect operation of the user interface. To mitigate this risk all user defined javascript is executed within a separate browser IFrame. In addition all javascript should be examined before being added to a production system unless the author is trusted. This may necessitate the creation of a separate development and testing environment for user content.\n"},"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html":{"url":"datasplitter/1-0-introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nData Splitter was created to transform text into XML. The XML produced is basic but can be processed further with XSLT to form any desired XML output.\nData Splitter works by using regular expressions to match a region of content or tokenizers to split content. The whole match or match group can then be output or passed to other expressions to further divide the matched data.\nThe root  element controls the way content is read and buffered from the source. It then passes this content on to one or more child expressions that attempt to match the content. The child expressions attempt to match content one at a time in the order they are specified until one matches. The matching expression then passes the content that it has matched to other elements that either emit XML or apply other expressions to the content matched by the parent.\nThis process of content supply, match, (supply, match)*, emit is best illustrated in a simple CSV example.

Both the root element  and  elements are content providers.\nRoot element \nThe root element of a Data Splitter configuration is . It supplies content from the input source to one or more expressions defined within it. The way that content is buffered is controlled by the root element and the way that errors are handled as a result of child expressions not matching all of the content it supplies.\nAttributes\nThe following attributes can be added to the  root element:\n\nignoreErrors\nbufferSize\n\nignoreErrors\nData Splitter generates errors if not all of the content is matched by the regular expressions beneath the  or within  elements. The error messages are intended to aid the user in writing good Data Splitter configurations. The intent is to indicate when the input data is not being matched fully and therefore possibly skipping some important data. Despite this, in some cases it is laborious to have to write expressions to match all content. In these cases it is preferable to add this attribute to ignore these errors. However it is often better to write expressions that capture all of the supplied content and discard unwanted characters. This attribute also affects errors generated by the use of the minMatch attribute on  which is described later on.\nTake the following example input:\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis could be matched with the following configuration:\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above configuration would only match up to a comment for each record line, e.g.\nName1,Name2,Name3\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nvalue1,value2,value3 # a useless comment\nThis may well be the desired functionality but if there was useful content within the comment it would be lost. Because of this Data Splitter warns you when expressions are failing to match all of the content presented so that you can make sure that you aren’t missing anything important. In the above example it is obvious that this is the required behaviour but in more complex cases you might be otherwise unaware that your expressions were losing data.\nTo maintain this assurance that you are handling all content it is usually best to write expressions to explicitly match all content even though you may do nothing with some matches, e.g.\n\n\n  \n…\n  \n  \n…\n  \n\n\nThe above example would match all of the content and would therefore not generate warnings. Sub-expressions of 'body' could use match group 1 and ignore the comment.\nHowever as previously stated it might often be difficult to write expressions that will just match content that is to be discarded. In these cases ignoreErrors can be used to suppress errors caused by unmatched content.\nbufferSize (Advanced)\nThis is an optional attribute used to tune the size of the character buffer used by Data Splitter. The default size is 20000 characters and should be fine for most translations. The minimum value that this can be set to is 20000 characters and the maximum is 1000000000. The only reason to specify this attribute is when individual records are bigger than 10000 characters which is rarely the case.\nGroup element \nGroups behave in a similar way to the root element in that they provide content for one or more inner expressions to deal with, e.g.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nAttributes\nAs the  element is a content provider it also includes the same 'ignoreErrors' attribute which behaves in the same way. The complete list of attributes for the  element is as follows:\n\nid\nvalue\nignoreErrors\nmatchOrder\nreverse\n\nid\nWhen Data Splitter reports errors it outputs an XPath to describe the part of the configuration that generated the error, e.g.\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nIt is often a little difficult to identify the configuration element that generated the error by looking at the path and the element description, particularly when multiple elements are the same, e.g. many  elements without attributes. To make identification easier you can add an 'id' attribute to any element in the configuration resulting in error descriptions as follows:\nDSParser [2:1] ERROR: Expressions failed to match all of the content provided by group: regex[0]/group[0]/regex[3]/group[1] : \nvalue\nThis attribute determines what content to present to child expressions. By default the entire content matched by a group’s parent expression is passed on by the group to child expressions. If required, content from a specific match group in the parent expression can be passed to child expressions using the value attribute, e.g. value=\"$1\". In addition to this content can be composed in the same way as it is for data names and values. see match references for a full description of match references.\nignoreErrors\nThis behaves in the same way as for the root element.\nmatchOrder\nThis is an optional attribute used to control how content is consumed by expression matches. Content can be consumed in sequence or in any order using matchOrder=\"sequence\" or matchOrder=\"any\". If the attribute is not specified, Data Splitter will default to matching in sequence.\nWhen matching in sequence, each match consumes some content and the content position is moved beyond the match ready for the subsequent match. However, in some cases the order of these constructs is not predictable, e.g. we may sometimes be presented with:\nValue1=1 Value2=2\n… or sometimes with:\nValue2=2 Value1=1\nUsing a sequential match order the following example would work to find both values in Value1=1 Value2=2\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\n… but this example would skip over Value2 and only find the value of Value1 if the input was Value2=2 Value1=1.\nTo be able to deal with content that contains these constructs in either order we need to change the match order to any.\nWhen matching in any order, each match removes the matched section from the content rather than moving the position past the match so that all remaining content can be matched by subsequent expressions. In the following example the first expression would match and remove Value1=1 from the supplied content and the second expression would be presented with Value2=2 which it could also match.\n\n  \n  ...\n  \n  ...\n\nIf the attribute is omitted by default the match order will be sequential. This is the default behaviour as tokens are most often in sequence and consuming content in this way is more efficient as content does not need to be copied by the parser to chop out sections as is required for matching in any order. It is only necessary to use this feature when fields that are identifiable with a specific match can occur in any order.\nreverse\nOccasionally it is desirable to reverse the content presented by a group to child expressions. This is because it is sometimes easier to form a pattern by matching content in reverse.\nTake the following example content of name, value pairs delimited by = but with no spaces between names, multiple spaces between values and only a space between subsequent pairs:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 location=loc1 A user=An end user serverName=bigserver\nWe could write a pattern that matches each name value pair by matching up to the start of the next name, e.g.\n\nThis would match the following:\nipAddress=123.123.123.123 zones=\nHere we are capturing the name and value for each pair in separate groups but the pattern has to also match the name from the next name value pair to find the end of the value. By default Data Splitter will move the content buffer to the end of the match ready for subsequent matches so the next name will not be available for matching.\nIn addition to matching too much content the above example also uses a reluctant qualifier .+?. Use of reluctant qualifiers almost always impacts performance so they are to be avoided if at all possible.\nA better way to match the example content is to match the input in reverse, reading characters from right to left.\nThe following example demonstrates this:\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nUsing the reverse attribute on the parent group causes content to be supplied to all child expressions in reverse order. In the above example this allows the pattern to match values followed by names which enables us to cope with the fact that values have multiple spaces but names have no spaces.\nContent is only presented to child regular expressions in reverse. When referencing values from match groups the content is returned in the correct order, e.g. the above example would return:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reverse feature isn't needed very often but there are a few cases where it really helps produce the desired output without the complexity and performance overhead of a reluctant match.\nAn alternative to using the reverse attribute is to use the original reluctant expression example but tell Data Splitter to make the subsequent name available for the next match by not advancing the content beyond the end of the previous value. This is done by using the advance attribute on the . However, the reverse attribute represents a better way to solve this particular problem and allows a simpler and more efficient regular expression to be used.\n"},"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-2-expressions.html","title":"Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Expressions\nExpressions match some data supplied by a parent content provider.

When specified this escape sequence also applies to any container characters that may be specified.\ncontainerStart\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression ignore the presence of delimiters until an end container is found.

If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\ncontainerEnd\nAn optional attribute used to specify a character sequence that will make this expression stop ignoring the presence of delimiters if it believes it is currently in a container.

If the container characters are to be ignored from the match then match group 1 must be used instead of 0.\nmaxMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the maximum number of times this expression is allowed to match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then the Data Splitter will keep matching the supplied content until it reaches the end. If specified Data Splitter will stop matching the supplied content when it has matched it the specified number of times.\nThis attribute is used in the 'CSV with header line' example to ensure that only the first line is treated as a header line.\nminMatch\nAn optional attribute used to specify the minimum number of times this expression should match the supplied content. If you do not supply this attribute then Data Splitter will not enforce that the expression matches the supplied content. If specified Data Splitter will generate an error if the expression does not match the supplied content at least as many times as specified.\nUnlike maxMatch, minMatch does not control the matching process but instead controls the production of error messages generated if the parser is not seeing the expected input.\nonlyMatch\nOptional attribute to use this expression only for specific instances of a match of the parent expression, e.g. on the 4th, 5th and 8th matches of the parent expression specified by '4,5,8'. This is used when this expression should only be used to subdivide content from certain parent matches.\nThe  element\nThe  element directs Data Splitter to match content using the specified regular expression pattern. In addition to this the same match control attributes that are available on the  element are also present as well as attributes to alter the way the pattern works.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\npattern\ndotAll\ncaseInsensitive\nmaxMatch\nminMatch\nonlyMatch\nadvance\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\npattern\nThis is a required attribute used to specify a regular expression to use to match on the supplied content. The pattern is used to match the content multiple times until the end of the content is reached while the maxMatch and onlyMatch conditions are satisfied.\ndotAll\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the use of '.' in the supplied pattern matches all characters including new lines. If 'true' '.' will match all characters including new lines, if 'false' it will only match up to a new line. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will only match up to a new line.\nThis attribute is used in many of the multiline examples above.\ncaseInsensitive\nAn optional attribute used to specify if the supplied pattern should match content in a case insensitive way. If 'true' the expression will match content in a case insensitive manner, if 'false' it will match the content in a case sensitive manner. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 'false' and will match the content in a case sensitive manner.\nmaxMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see maxMatch.\nminMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see minMatch.\nonlyMatch\nThis is used in the same way it is on the  element, see onlyMatch.\nadvance\nAfter an expression has matched content in the buffer, the buffer start position is advanced so that it moves to the end of the entire match. This means that subsequent expressions operating on the content buffer will not see the previously matched content again. This is normally required behaviour, but in some cases some of the content from a match is still required for subsequent matches. Take the following example of name value pairs:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nThe first name value pair could be matched with the following expression:\n\n\nThe above expression would match as follows:\nname1=some value 1 name2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nIn this example we have had to do a reluctant match to extract the value in group 2 and not include the subsequent name. Because the reluctant match requires us to specify what we are reluctantly matching up to, we have had to include an expression after it that matches the next name.\nBy default the parser will move the character buffer to the end of the entire match so the next expression will be presented with the following:\nsome value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will have been lost from the content buffer and will not be available for matching.\nThis behaviour can be altered by telling the expression how far to advance the character buffer after matching. This is done with the advance attribute and is used to specify the match group whose end position should be treated as the point the content buffer should advance to, e.g.\n\n\nIn this example the content buffer will only advance to the end of match group 2 and subsequent expressions will be presented with the following content:\nname2=some value 2 name3=some value 3\nTherefore name2 will still be available in the content buffer.\nIt is likely that the advance feature will only be useful in cases where a reluctant match is performed. Reluctant matches are discouraged for performance reasons so this feature should rarely be used. A better way to tackle the above example would be to present the content in reverse, however this is only possible if the expression is within a group, i.e. is not a root expression. There may also be more complex cases where reversal is not an option and the use of a reluctant match is the only option.\nThe  element\nThe  element matches the entire content of the parent group and makes it available to child groups or  elements. The purpose of  is to act as a catch all expression to deal with content that is not handled by a more specific expression, e.g. to output some other unknown, unrecognised or unexpected data.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThe  element provides the same functionality as using .* as a pattern in a  element and where dotAll is set to true, e.g. . However it performs much faster as it doesn’t require pattern matching logic and is therefore always preferred.\nAttributes\nThe  element has the following attributes:\n\nid\n\nid\nOptional attribute used to debug the location of expressions causing errors, see id.\n"},"datasplitter/2-3-variables.html":{"url":"datasplitter/2-3-variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nA variable is added to Data Splitter using the  element.

In addition to this a match group number may be added to just retrieve part of the expression match.

However there are various match groups that can be used by child  and  elements to reference sections of the matched content.\nTo illustrate the content provided by each match group, take the following example:\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\", \"This is the next text\"\nAnd the following  element:\n\n\nThe match groups are as follows:\n\n$ or $0: The entire content that is matched including the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\",\n\n$1: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"This is some text\\, that we wish to match\"\n\n$2: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and filtered to remove escape characters (more expensive than $1)\n\n\"This is some text, that we wish to match\"\nIn addition to this behaviour match groups 1 and 2 will omit outermost whitespace and container characters if specified, e.g. with the following content:\n\"  This is some text\\, that we wish to match  \"  , \"This is the next text\"\nAnd the following  element:\n\n\nThe match groups are as follows:\n\n$ or $0: The entire content that is matched including the specified delimiter at the end\n\n\"  This is some text\\, that we wish to match  \"  ,\n\n$1: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and strips outer containers.\n\nThis is some text\\, that we wish to match\n\n$2: The content up to the specified delimiter at the end and strips outer containers and filtered to remove escape characters (more computationally expensive than $1)\n\nThis is some text, that we wish to match\nReferences to  Match Groups\nLike the  element various match groups can be referenced in a  expression to retrieve portions of matched content.

Each variable must have a unique id so that it can be referenced. References to variables have the form $VARIABLE_ID$, e.g.\n\n\nIdentification\nData Splitter validates the configuration on load and ensures that all element ids are unique and that referenced ids belong to a variable.\nA variable will only store data if it is referenced so variables that are not referenced will do nothing. In addition to this a variable will only store data for match groups that are referenced, e.g. if $heading$1 is the only reference to a variable with an id of ‘heading’ then only data for match group 1 will be stored for reference lookup.\nScopes\nVariables have two scopes which affect how data is retrieved when referenced:\n\nLocal scope\nRemote scope\n\nLocal Scope\nVariables are local to a reference if the reference exists as a descendant of the variables parent expression, e.g.\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example, matches for the outermost  expression are stored in the variable with the id of line. The only reference to this variable is in a data element that is a descendant of the variables parent expression , i.e. it is nested within split/group/regex.\nBecause the variable is referenced locally only the most recent parent match is relevant, i.e. no retrieval of values by \niteration, iteration offset or fixed position is applicable. These features only apply to remote variables that store multiple values.\nRemote Scope\nThe CSV example with a heading is an example of a variable being referenced from a remote scope.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n      \n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the above example the parent expression of the variable is not the ancestor of the reference in the  element. This makes the  elements reference to the variable a remote one. In this situation the variable knows that it must store multiple values as the remote reference  may retrieve one of many values from the variable based on:\n\nThe match count of the parent expression.\nThe match count of the parent expression, plus or minus an offset.\nA fixed position in the variable store.\n\nRetrieval of value by iteration\nIn the above example the first line is taken then repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas. This results in multiple values being stored in the ‘heading’ variable. Once this is done subsequent lines are matched and then also repeatedly matched by delimiting with commas in the same way the heading is.\nEach time a line is matched the internal match count of all sub expressions, (e.g. the  expression that is delimited by comma) is reset to 0. Every time the sub  expression matches up to a comma delimiter the match count is incremented. Any references to remote variables will, by default, use the current match count as an index to retrieve one of the many values stored in the variable. This means that the  element in the above example will retrieve the corresponding heading for each value as the match count of the values will match the storage position of each heading.\nRetrieval of value by iteration offset\nIn some cases there may be a mismatch between the position where a value is stored in a variable and the match count applicable when remotely referencing the variable.\nTake the following input:\nBAD,Date,Time,IPAddress,HostName,User,EventType,Detail\n01/01/2010,00:00:00,192.168.1.100,SOMEHOST.SOMEWHERE.COM,user1,logon,\nIn the above example we can see that the first heading ‘BAD’ is not correct for the first value of every line. In this situation we could either adjust the way the heading line is parsed to ignore ‘BAD’ or just adjust the way the heading variable is referenced.\nTo make this adjustment the reference just needs to be told what offset to apply to the current match count to correctly retrieve the stored value. In the above example this would be done like this:\n\n\nThe above reference just uses the match count plus 1 to retrieve the stored value. Any integral offset plus or minus may be used, e.g. [+4] or [-10]. Offsets that result in a position that is outside of the storage range for the variable will not return a value.\nRetrieval of value by fixed position\nIn addition to retrieval by offset from the current match count, a stored value can be returned by a fixed position that has no relevance to the current match count.\nIn the following example the value retrieved from the ‘heading’ variable will always be ‘IPAddress’ as this is the fourth value stored in the ‘heading’ variable and the position index starts at 0.\n\n\n"},"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html":{"url":"datasplitter/3-3-use-of-fixed-strings.html","title":"Use of fixed strings","keywords":"","body":"Use of fixed strings\nAny  value or  name and value can use references to matched content, but in addition to this it is possible just to output a known string, e.g.\n\n\nThe above example would output somename as the  name attribute.

Following this HOWTO will produce a simple, minimally secured database deployment. In a production environment consideration needs to be made for redundancy, better security, data-store location, increased memory usage, and the like.\nStroom has two databases. The first, stroom, is used for management of Stroom itself and the second, statistics is used for the Stroom Statistics capability. There are many ways to deploy these two databases. One could\n\nhave a single database instance and serve both databases from it\nhave two database instances on the same server and serve one database per instance\nhave two separate nodes, each with it's own database instance\nthe list goes on.\n\nIn this HOWTO, we describe the deployment of two database instances on the one node, each serving a single database. We provide example deployments using either the MariaDB or MySQL Community versions of MySQL.\nAssumptions\n\nwe are installing the MariaDB or MySQL Community RDBMS software.\nthe primary database node is 'stroomdb0.strmdev00.org'.\ninstallation is on a fully patched minimal Centos 7.3 instance.\nwe are installing BOTH databases (stroom and statistics) on the same node - 'stroomdb0.stromdev00.org' but with two distinct database engines. The first database will communicate on port 3307 and the second on 3308.\nwe are deploying with SELinux in enforcing mode.\nany scripts or commands that should run are in code blocks and are designed to allow the user to cut then paste the commands onto their systems.\nin this document, when a textual screen capture is documented, data entry is identified by the data surrounded by '' . This excludes enter/return presses.\n\nInstallation of Software\nMariaDB Server Installation\nAs MariaDB is directly supported by Centos 7, we simply install the database server software and SELinux policy files, as per\nsudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python mariadb-server\n\nMySQL Community Server Installation\nAs MySQL is not directly supported by Centos 7, we need to install it's repository files prior to installation.\nWe get the current MySQL Community release repository rpm and validate it's MD5 checksum against the published value found on the\nMySQL Yum Repository site.\nwget https://repo.mysql.com/mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\nmd5sum mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\n\nOn correct validation of the MD5 checksum, we install the repository files via\nsudo yum -y localinstall mysql57-community-release-el7.rpm\n\nNOTE: Stroom currently does not support the latest production MySQL version - 5.7. You will need to install MySQL Version 5.6.\nNow since we must use MySQL Version 5.6 you will need to edit the MySQL repo file /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo to\ndisable the mysql57-community channel and enable the mysql56-community channel. We start by, backing up the repo file with\nsudo cp /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo.ORIG\n\nThen edit the file to change\n...\n# Enable to use MySQL 5.6\n[mysql56-community]\nname=MySQL 5.6 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=0\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n\n[mysql57-community]\nname=MySQL 5.7 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n...\nto become\n...\n# Enable to use MySQL 5.6\n[mysql56-community]\nname=MySQL 5.6 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n\n[mysql57-community]\nname=MySQL 5.7 Community Server\nbaseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/\nenabled=0\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql\n...\nNext we install server software and SELinux policy files, as per\nsudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python mysql-community-server\n\nPreparing the Database Deployment\nMariaDB Variant\nCreate and instantiate both database instances\nTo set up two MariaDB database instances on the one node, we will use mysql_multi and systemd service templates. The mysql_multi utility is a capability that manages multiple MariaDB databases on the same node and systemd service templates manage multiple services from one configuration file.  A systemd service template is unique in that it has an @ character before the .service suffix.\nTo use this multiple-instance capability, we need to create two data directories for each database instance and also replace the main MariaDB configuration file, /etc/my.cnf, with one that includes configuration of key options for each instance. We will name our instances, mysqld0 and mysqld1. We will also create specific log files for each instance.\nWe will use the directories, /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0 and /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1 for the data directories and /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log and /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log for the log files. Note you should modify /etc/logrotate.d/mariadb to manage these log files. Note also, we need to set the appropriate SELinux file contexts on the created directories and any files.\nWe create the data directories and log files and set their respective SELinux contexts via\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t \"/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0(/.*)?\"\nsudo restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\n\nsudo touch /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\nsudo chcon --reference=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld0.log\n\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\nsudo semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t \"/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1(/.*)?\"\nsudo restorecon -Rv /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\n\nsudo touch /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\nsudo chown mysql:mysql /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\nsudo chcon --reference=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log /var/log/mariadb/mysql-mysqld1.log\n\nWe now initialise the our two database data directories via\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0\nsudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1\n\nWe now replace the  MySQL configuration file to set the options for each instance. Note that we will serve mysqld0 and mysqld1 via TCP ports 3307 and 3308 respectively.

At this we create the database with\ncreate database stroom;\n\nand then to establish the users, we execute\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@localhost identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp00.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp01.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\n\nthen\nquit;\n\nto exit.\nAnd for the statistics database \nmysql --user=root --port=3308 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/mysql.sock --password\n\nwith\ncreate database statistics;\n\nand then to establish the users, we execute\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@localhost identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@stroomp00.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\ngrant all privileges on statistics.* to stroomstats@stroomp01.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword2@';\n\nthen\nquit;\n\nto exit.\nClearly if we need to add more processing nodes, additional grant commands would be used. Further, if we were installing the databases in a single node Stroom environment, we would just have the first two pairs of grants.\nConfigure Firewall\nNext we need to modify our firewall to allow remote access to our databases which listens on ports 3307 and 3308.\nThe simplest way to achieve this is with the commands\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3307/tcp --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3308/tcp --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nNote that this allows ANY node to connect to your databases. You should give consideration to restricting this to only allowing processing node access.\nDebugging of Mariadb for Stroom\nIf there is a need to debug the Mariadb database and Stroom interaction, one can turn on auditing for the Mariadb service.\nTo do so, log onto the relevant database as the administrative user as per\nmysql --user=root --port=3307 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0/mysql.sock --password\nor\nmysql --user=root --port=3308 --socket=/var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/mysql.sock --password\n\nand at the MariaDB [(none)]> prompt enter\ninstall plugin server_audit SONAME 'server_audit';\nset global server_audit_file_path='/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld0_server_audit.log';\nor\nset global server_audit_file_path='/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld1_server_audit.log';\nset global server_audit_logging=ON;\nset global server_audit_file_rotate_size=10485760;\ninstall plugin SQL_ERROR_LOG soname 'sql_errlog';\nquit;\n\nThe above will generate two log files, \n\n/var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld0_server_audit.log or /var/log/mariadb/mysqld-mysqld1_server_audit.log which records all commands the respective databases run. We have configured the log file will rotate at 10MB in size.\n/var/lib/mysql-mysqld0/sql_errors.log or /var/lib/mysql-mysqld1/sql_errors.log which records all erroneous SQL commands. This log file will rotate at 10MB in size. Note we cannot set this filename via the UI, but it will be appear in the data directory.\nAll files will, by default, generate up to 9 rotated files.\n\nIf you wish to rotate a log file manually, log into the database as the administrative user and execute either\n\nset global server_audit_file_rotate_now=1; to rotate the audit log file\nset global sql_error_log_rotate=1; to rotate the sql_errlog log file\n\nInitial Database Access\nIt should be noted that if you monitor the sql_errors.log log file on a new Stooom deployment, when the Stoom Application first starts, it's initial access to the stroom database will result in the following attempted sql statements.\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.schema_version' doesn't exist : SELECT version FROM schema_version ORDER BY installed_rank DESC\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.STROOM_VER' doesn't exist : SELECT VER_MAJ, VER_MIN, VER_PAT FROM STROOM_VER ORDER BY VER_MAJ DESC, VER_MIN DESC, VER_PAT DESC LIMIT 1\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.FD' doesn't exist : SELECT ID FROM FD LIMIT 1\n2017-04-16 16:24:50 stroomuser[stroomuser] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'stroom.FEED' doesn't exist : SELECT ID FROM FEED LIMIT 1\n\nAfter this access the application will realise the database does not exist and it will initialise the database.\nIn the case of the statistics database you may note the following attempted access\n2017-04-16 16:25:09 stroomstats[stroomstats] @ stroomp00.strmdev00.org [192.168.2.126] ERROR 1146: Table 'statistics.schema_version' doesn't exist : SELECT version FROM schema_version ORDER BY installed_rank DESC\n\nAgain, at this point the application will initialise this database.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHowTo.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Installation\nThis HOWTO is provided to assist users in setting up a number of different Stroom environments based on Centos 7.3 infrastructure.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions are used in this document.\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills.\ninstallations are on Centos 7.3 minimal systems (fully patched).\nthe term 'node' is used to reference the 'host' a service is running on. \nthe Stroom Proxy and Application software runs as user 'stroomuser' and will be deployed in this user's home directory\ndata will reside in a directory tree referenced via '/stroomdata'. It is up to the user to provision a filesystem here, noting sub-directories of it will be NFS shared in Multi Node Stroom Deployments\nany scripts or commands that should run are in code blocks and are designed to allow the user to cut then paste the commands onto their systems\nin this document, when a textual screen capture is documented, data entry is identified by the data surrounded by '' . This excludes enter/return presses.\nbetter security of password choices, networking, firewalls, data stores, etc. can and should be achieved in various ways, but these HOWTOs are just a quick means of getting a working system, so only limited security is applied\nbetter configuration of the database (e.g. more memory. redundancy) should be considered in production environments\nthe use of self signed certificates is appropriate for test systems, but users should consider appropriate CA infrastructure in production environments\nthe user has access to a Chrome web browser as Stroom is optimised for this browser.\n\nIntroduction\nThis HOWTO provides guidance on a variety of simple Stroom deployments.\n\nMulti Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application)\nfor an environment where multiple nodes are required to handle the processing load.\n\nForwarding Stroom Proxy\nfor extensive networks where one wants to aggregate data through a proxy before sending data to the central Stroom processing systems.\n\nStandalone Stroom Proxy\nfor disconnected networks where collected data can be manually transferred to a Stroom processing service.\n\nAddition of a Node to Stroom Cluster\nfor when one needs to add an additional node to an existing cluster.\n\n\nNodename Nomenclature\nFor simplicity sake, the nodenames used in this HOWTO are geared towards the Multi Node Stroom Cluster deployment. That is,\n\nthe database nodename is stroomdb0.strmdev00.org\nthe processing nodenames are stroomp00.strmdev00.org, stroomp01.strmdev00.org, and stroomp02.strmdev00.org\nthe first node in our cluster, stroomp00.strmdev00.org, also has the CNAME stroomp.strmdev00.org\n\nIn the case of the Proxy only deployments,\n\nthe forwarding Stroom proxy nodename is stoomfp0.strmdev00.org\nthe standalone nodename will be stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nStorage\nBoth the Stroom Proxy and Application store data. The typical requirement is\n\ndirectory for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\ndirectory for Stroom application permanent data files (events, etc.)\ndirectory for Stroom application index data files\ndirectory for Stroom application working files (temporary files, output, etc.)\n\nWhere multiple processing nodes are involved, the application's permanent data directories need to be accessible by all participating nodes. \nThus a hierarchy for a Stroom Proxy might by\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-proxy\n\nand for an Application node\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data\n/stroomdata/stroom-index\n/stroomdata/stroom-working\n\nIn the following examples, the storage hierarchy proposed will more suited for a multi node Stroom cluster, including the Forwarding or\nStandalone proxy deployments. This is to simplify the documentation. Thus, the above structure is generalised into\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-pnn/proxy\n\nand\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-pnn\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-pnn\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-pnn\n\nwhere nn is a two digit node number. The reason for placing the proxy directory within the Application working area\nwill be explained later.\nAll data should be owned by the Stroom processing user. In this HOWTO, we will use stroomuser\nMulti Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application) Deployment\nIn this deployment we will install the database on a given node then deploy both the Stroom Proxy and Stroom Application software\nto both our processing nodes. At this point we will then integrate a web service to run 'in-front' of our Stroom software and\nthen perform the initial configuration of Stroom via the user interface.\nDatabase Installation\nThe Stroom capability requires access to two MySQL/MariaDB databases. The first is for persisting application configuration and metadata information, and the second is for the Stroom Statistics capability.\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom databases can be found here.\nAlthough these instructions describe the deployment of the databases to their own node, there is no reason why one can't\njust install them both on the first (or only) Stroom node.\nPrerequisite Software Installation\nCertain software packages are required for either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\nmariadb or mysql client\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\n\nOne has a choice of database clients. MariaDB is directly supported by Centos 7 and is simplest to install. This is done via\nsudo yum -y install mariadb\n\nOne could deploy the MySQL database software as the alternative.\nTo do this you need to install the MySQL Community repository files then install the client. \nInstructions for installation of the MySQL Community repository files can be\nfound here or on\nthe MySQL Site.\nOnce you have installed the MySQL repository files, install the client via\nsudo yum -y install mysql-community-client\n\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the Web Service Integration section of this document.\nNote also, that Standalone or Forwarding Stroom Proxy deployments do NOT need a database client deployed.\nEntropy Issues in Virtual environments\nBoth the Stroom Application and Stroom Proxy currently run on Tomcat (Version 7) which relies on the Java SecureRandom class to provide\nrandom values for any generated session identifiers as well as other components. In some circumstances the Java runtime can be delayed if the entropy source that is\nused to initialise SecureRandom is short of entropy. The delay is caused by the Java runtime waiting on the blocking entropy souce\n/dev/random to have sufficient entropy. This quite often occurs in virtual environments were there are few sources that can contribute to \na system's entropy.\nTo view the current available entropy on a Linux system, run the command\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail\n\nA reasonable value would be over 2000 and a poor value would be below a few hundred.\nIf you are deploying Stroom onto systems with low available entropy, the start time for the Stroom Proxy can be as high as 5 minutes and for\nthe Application as high as 15 minutes.\nOne software based solution would be to install the haveged service that attempts to provide an easy-to-use, unpredictable random number generator based upon an adaptation of the HAVEGE algorithm.\nTo install execute\nyum -y install haveged\nsystemctl enable haveged\nsystemctl start haveged\n\nFor background reading in this matter, see this reference or this reference.\nStorage Scenario\nFor the purpose of this Installation HOWTO, the following sets up the storage hierarchy for a two node processing\ncluster. To share our permanent data we will use NFS. Accept that the NFS deployment described here is very simple, and\nin a production deployment, a lot more security controls should be used. Further, \nOur hierarchy is\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00    - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00    - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00    - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01    - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01    - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01    - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nCreation of Storage Hierarchy\nSo, we first create processing user on all nodes as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nAnd the relevant commands to create the above hierarchy would be\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01  # So that this node can mount stroomp01's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00  # So that this node can mount stroomp00's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nDeployment of NFS to share Stroom Storage\nWe will use NFS to cross mount the permanent data directories. That is\n\nnode stroomp00.strmdev00.org will mount stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 and,\nnode stroomp01.strmdev00.org will mount stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00.\n\nThe HOWTO guide to deploy and configure NFS for our Scenario is here\nStroom Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere.\nStroom Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here.\nStroom Application Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom application can be found here.\nWeb Service Integration\nOne typically 'fronts' either a Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service. The following\nprovides instructions for this. The created certificates can then be used when configuration the web service.\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nInstallation Validation\nWe will now check that the installation and web services integration has worked.\nSanity firewall check\nTo ensure you have the firewall correctly set up, the following command\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nshould result in\npublic (active)\n  target: default\n  icmp-block-inversion: no\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client http https nfs ssh\n  ports: 8009/tcp 9080/tcp 8080/tcp 9009/tcp\n  protocols: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  sourceports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules:\nTest Posting of data to the Stroom service\nYou can test the data posting service with the command\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nwhich *WILL) result in an error as we have not configured the Stroom Application as yet.

In this deployment, you should enter the URLS\nhttp://stroomp.strmdev00.org, or https://stroomp.strmdev00.org or https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom, noting the first URLs\nshould automatically direct you to the last URL.\nIf you have personal certificates loaded in your Chrome browser, you may be asked which certificate to use to authenticate yourself\nto stroomp.strmdev00.org:443. As Stroom has not been configured to use user certificates, the choice is not relevant, just choose one\nand continue.\nAdditionally, if you are using  self-signed certificates, your browser will generate an alert as per\n\nTo proceed you need to select the ADVANCED hyperlink to see\n\nIf you select the Proceed to stroomp.strmdev00.org (unsafe) hyper-link you will be presented with the standard Stroom UI login page.\n\nThis page has two panels - About Stroom and Login.\nIn the About Stroom panel we see an introductory description of Stroom in the top left and deployment details in the bottom left of the panel. The deployment details provide\n\nBuild Version: - the build version of the Stroom application deployed\nBuild Date: - the date the version was built\nUp Date: - the install date\nNode Name: - the node within the Stroom cluster you have connected to\n\nLogin with Stroom default Administrative User\nEach new Stroom deployment automatically creates the administrative user admin and this user's password is initially set to admin.\nWe will\nlogin as this user\nwhich also validates that the database and UI is working correctly in that you can login and the password is admin.\nCreate an Attributed User to perform configuration\nWe should configure Stroom using an attributed user account.\nThat is, we should\ncreate\na user, in our case it will be burn (the author) and once created, we login with that account then perform the initial configuration activities.\nYou don't have to do this, but it is sound security practice.\nOnce you have created the user you should\nlog out\nof the admin account and log back in as our user burn.\nConfigure the Volumes for our Stroom deployment\nBefore we can store data within Stroom we need to configure the\nvolumes\nwe have allocated in our Storage hierarchy. The\nVolume Maintenance HOWTO\nshows how to do this.\nConfigure the Nodes for our Stroom deployment\nIn a Stroom cluster, nodes are expected to communicate with each other on port 8080 over http. Our\ninstallation in a multi node environment ensures the firewall will allow this but we also need to\nconfigure the nodes. This is achieved via the Stroom UI where we set a Cluster URL for each node.\nThe following Node Configuration HOWTO demonstrates how do\nset the Cluster URL.\nData Stream Processing\nTo enable Stroom to process data, it's\nStream Processors\nneed to be enabled. There are NOT enabled by default on installation. The following\nsection\nin our Stroom Tasks HowTo shows how to do this.\nTesting our Stroom Application and Proxy Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that we can send and ingest data.\nAdd a Test Feed\nIn order for Stroom to be able to handle various data sources, be they Apache HTTPD web access logs,\nMicroSoft Windows Event logs or Squid Proxy logs, Stroom must be told what the data is when it is received.\nThis is achieved using\nEvent Feeds.\nEach feed has a unique name within the system.\nTo test our installation can accept and ingest data, we will\ncreate a test Event feed. The 'name' of the feed will be\nTEST-FEED-V1_0. Note that in a production environment is is best that a well defined nomenclature is used for feed 'names'. For our\ntesting purposes TEST-FEED-V1_0 is sufficient.\nSending Test Data\nNOTE: Before testing our new feed, we should restart both our Stroom application services so that any volume changes are\npropagated. This can be achieved by simply running\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\nbin/StopServices.sh\nbin/StartServices.sh\n\non both nodes. It is suggested you first log out of Stroom, if you are currently logged in and you should monitor the Stroom\napplication logs to ensure it has successfully restarted. Remember to use the T and Tp bash aliases we set up.\nFor this test, we will send the contents of /etc/group to our test feed. We will also send the file from the cluster's database\nmachine. The command to send this file is\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomp.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nWe will test a number of features as part of our installation test. These are\n\nsimple post of data\nsimple post of data to validate load balancing is working\nsimple post to direct feed interface\nsimple post to direct feed interface to validate load balancing is working\nidentify that the Stroom Proxy Aggregation is working correctly\n\nAs part of our testing will check the presence of the inbound data, as files, within the proxy storage area.\nNow as the proxy storage area is also the location from which the Stroom application\nautomatically aggregates then ingests the data stored by the proxy, we can either turn off the\nProxy Aggregation task,\nor attempt to\nperform our tests noting that proxy aggregation occurs every 10 minutes by default. For simplicity, we will\nturn off the Proxy Aggregation task.\nWe can now perform out tests. Follow the steps in the Data Posting Tests section\nof the Testing Stroom Installation HOWTO\nForwarding Stroom Proxy Deployment\nIn this deployment will install a Stroom Forwarding Proxy which is designed to aggregate data posted to it for managed forwarding to \na central Stroom processing system. This scenario is assuming we are installing on the fully patch Centos 7.3 host, stroomfp0.strmdev00.org.\nFurther it assumes we have installed, configured and tested the destination Stroom system we will be forwarding to.\nWe will first deploy the Stroom Proxy then configure it as a Forwarding Proxy then integrate a web service to run 'in-front' of\nProxy.\nPrerequisite Software Installation for Forwarding Proxy\nCertain software packages are required for the Stroom Proxy to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\n\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the\nWeb Service Integration for Forwarding Proxy\nsection of this document.\nForwarding Proxy Storage\nSince we are a proxy that stores data sent to it and forwards it each minute we have only one directory.\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files prior to forwarding\n\nYou will note that these HOWTOs use a consistent storage nomenclature for simplicity of documentations.\nCreation of Storage for Forwarding Proxy\nWe create the processing user, as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage hierarchy with the commands\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nStroom Forwarding Proxy Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing the Stroom Forwarding Proxy, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Although this setup HOWTO is orientated towards a complete Stroom Proxy\nand Application installation, it does provide all the processing user setup requirements for a Stroom Proxy as well.\nStroom Forwarding Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here, noting you\nshould follow the steps for configuring the proxy as a Forwarding proxy.\nWeb Service Integration for Forwarding Proxy\nOne typically 'fronts' a Stroom Proxy with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service. The\nSSL Certificate Generation HOWTO provides instructions for this. \nThe created certificates can then be used when configuration the web service. NOTE also, that for a forwarding\nproxy we will need to establish Key and Trust stores as well. This is also documented in the SSL Certificate Generation HOWTO\nhere\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here. Please take note of where a Stroom Proxy\nconfiguration item is different to that of a Stroom Application processing node.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nTesting our Forwarding Proxy Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that we can send data to the forwarding proxy and that it forwards the files\nit receives to the central Stroom processing system. As stated earlier, it is assumed we have installed, configured and tested the destination\ncentral Stroom processing system and thus we will have a test Feed\nalready established - TEST-FEED-V1_0.\nSending Test Data\nFor this test, we will send the contents of /etc/group to our test feed - TEST-FEED-V1_0. It doesn't matter from which host we send the file from.\nThe command to send file is\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomfp0.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nBefore testing, it is recommended you set up to monitor the Stroom proxy logs on the central server as well as on the Forwarding Proxy server.\nFollow the steps in the Forwarding Proxy Data Posting Tests section\nof the Testing Stroom Installation HOWTO\nStandalone Stroom Proxy Deployment\nIn this deployment will install a Stroom Standalone Proxy which is designed to accept and store data posted to it for manual forwarding to \na central Stroom processing system. This scenario is assuming we are installing on the fully patch Centos 7.3 host, stroomsap0.strmdev00.org.\nWe will first deploy the Stroom Proxy then configure it as a Standalone Proxy then integrate a web service to run 'in-front' of\nProxy.\nPrerequisite Software Installation for Forwarding Proxy\nCertain software packages are required for the Stroom Proxy to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\n\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the\nWeb Service Integration for Standalone Proxy\nsection of this document.\nStandalone Proxy Storage\nSince we are a proxy that stores data sent to it we have only one directory.\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy    - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\nYou will note that these HOWTOs use a consistent storage nomenclature for simplicity of documentations.\nCreation of Storage for Standalone Proxy\nWe create the processing user, as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage hierarchy with the commands\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-working-sap0/proxy\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nStroom Standalone Proxy Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing the Stroom Standalone Proxy, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Although this setup HOWTO is orientated towards a complete Stroom Proxy\nand Application installation, it does provide all the processing user setup requirements for a Stroom Proxy as well.\nStroom Standalone Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here, noting you\nshould follow the steps for configuring the proxy as a  Store_NoDB proxy.\nWeb Service Integration for Standalone Proxy\nOne typically 'fronts' a Stroom Proxy with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nWe first need to create certificates for use by the web service. The\nSSL Certificate Generation HOWTO provides instructions for this. \nThe created certificates can then be used when configuration the web service. There is no need for Trust or Key stores.\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications.

It doesn't matter from which host we send the file from.\nThe command to send file is\ncurl -k --data-binary @/etc/group \"https://stroomsap0.strmdev00.org/stroom/datafeed\" -H \"Feed:TEST-FEED-V1_0\" -H \"System:EXAMPLE_SYSTEM\" -H \"Environment:EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT\"\n\nBefore testing, it is recommended you set up to monitor the Standalone Proxy logs.\nFollow the steps in the Standalone Proxy Data Posting Tests\nsection of the Testing Stroom Installation HOWTO\nAddition of a Node to a Stroom Cluster Deployment\nIn this deployment we will deploy both the Stroom Proxy and Stroom Application software\nto a new processing node we wish to add to our cluster. Once we have deploy and configured the Stroom software, we will then integrate a web\nservice to run 'in-front' of our Stroom software, and then perform the initial configuration of to add this node via the user interface. The\nnode we will add is stroomp02.strmdev00.org.\nGrant access to the database for this node\nConnect to the Stroom database as the administrative (root) user, via the command\nsudo mysql --user=root -p\n\nand at the MariaDB [(none)]> or mysql> prompt enter\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@stroomp02.strmdev00.org identified by 'Stroompassword1@';\nquit;\n\nPrerequisite Software Installation\nCertain software packages are required for either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application to run.\nThe core software list is\n\njava-1.8.0-openjdk\njava-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\npolicycoreutils-python\nunzip\nzip\nmariadb or mysql client\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel policycoreutils-python unzip zip\nsudo yum -y install mariadb\n\nIn the above instance, the database client choice is MariaDB as it is directly supported by Centos 7. One could deploy the MySQL\ndatabase software as the alternative. If you have chosen a different database for the already deployed Stroom Cluster then you\nshould use that one. See earlier in this document on how to install the MySQL Community client.\nNote that additional software will be required for other integration components (e.g. Apache httpd/mod_jk). This is\ndescribed in the Web Service Integration section of this document.\nStorage Scenario\nTo maintain our Storage Scenario them, the scenario for this node is\n\nNode: stroomp02.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. tmp, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nCreation of Storage Hierarchy\nSo, we first create processing user on our new node as per\nsudo useradd stroomuser\n\nthen create the storage via\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-index-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00  # So that this node can mount stroomp00's data directory\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01  # So that this node can mount stroomp01's data directory\nsudo chown -R stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata\nsudo chmod -R 750 /stroomdata\n\nAs we need to share this new nodes permanent data directories to the existing nodes in the Cluster, we need to\ncreate mount point directories on our existing nodes in addition to deploying NFS.\nSo we execute on\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chmod 750 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chown stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nand on \n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.orgsudo mkdir -p /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chmod 750 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\nsudo chown stroomuser:stroomuser /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nDeployment of NFS to share Stroom Storage\n\n\nWe will use NFS to cross mount the permanent data directories. That is\n\nnode stroomp00.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 and,\nstroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 and,\n\n\nnode stroomp01.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 and\nstroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\n\nnode stroomp02.strmdev00.org will mount\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 and\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\n\n\nThe HOWTO guide to deploy and configure NFS for our Scenario is here.\nStroom Installation\nPre-installation setup\nBefore installing either the Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application, we need establish various files and scripts within\nthe Stroom Processing user's home directory to support the Stroom services and their persistence. This is setup is described\nhere. Note you should remember to set the N bash variable \nwhen generating the Environment Variable files to 02.\nStroom Proxy Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom Proxy can be found here. Note you\nwill be deploying a Store proxy and during the setup execution ensure you enter the appropriate values for NODE ('stroomp02')\nand REPO_DIR ('/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy'). All other values will be the same.\nStroom Application Installation\nInstructions for installation of the Stroom application can be found here.\nWhen executing the setup script ensure you enter the appropriate values for TEMP_DIR ('/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02') and NODE ('stroomp02').\nAll other values will be the same. Note also that you will not have to wait for the 'first' node to initialise the Stroom database as\nthis would have already been done when you first deployed your Stroom Cluster.\nWeb Service Integration\nOne typically 'fronts' either a Stroom Proxy or Stroom Application with a secure web service such as Apache's Httpd or NGINX.\nIn our scenario, we will use SSL to secure the web service and further, we will use Apache's Httpd.\nAs we are a cluster, we use the same certificate as the other nodes. Thus we need to gain the certificate package from an existing node.\nSo, on stroomp00.strmdev00.org, we replicate the directory ~stroomuser/stroom-jks to our new node. That is, tar it up, copy the tar file to\nstroomp02 and untar it. We can make use of the other node's mounted file system.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar cf stroom-jks.tar stroom-jks\nmv stroom-jks.tar /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\nthen on our new node (stroomp02.strmdev00.org) we extract the data.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar xf /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02/stroom-jks.tar && rm -f /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02/stroom-jks.tar\n\nNow ensure protection, ownership and SELinux context for these files by running\nchmod 700 ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/private ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchown -R stroomuser:stroomuser ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchcon -R --reference /etc/pki ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\n\nThis HOWTO is designed to deploy Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) (to the user) and\nApache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications. The instructions\nto configure this can be found here.\nYou should pay particular attention to the section on the\nApache Mod_JK configuration\nas you MUST regenerate the Mod_JK workers.properties file on the existing cluster nodes as well as generating it on our new node.\nOther Web service capability can be used, for example, NGINX.\nNote that once you have integrated the web services for our new node, you will need to restart the Apache systemd process on the existing\ntwo nodes that that the new Mod_JK configuration has taken place.\nInstallation Validation\nWe will now check that the installation and web services integration has worked. We do this with a simple firewall check\nand later perform complete integration tests.\nSanity firewall check\nTo ensure you have the firewall correctly set up, the following command\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\nshould result in\npublic (active)\n  target: default\n  icmp-block-inversion: no\n  interfaces: enp0s3\n  sources: \n  services: dhcpv6-client http https nfs ssh\n  ports: 8009/tcp 9080/tcp 8080/tcp 9009/tcp\n  protocols: \n  masquerade: no\n  forward-ports: \n  sourceports: \n  icmp-blocks: \n  rich rules:\nStroom Application Configuration - New Node\nWe will need to configure this new node's Volumes, set it's Cluster URL and enable it's Stream Processors.\nWe do this by logging into the Stroom User Interface (UI) with an account with Administrator privileges. It\nis recommended you use a attributed user for this activity. Once you have logged in you can configure this\nnew node.\nConfigure the Volumes for our Stroom deployment\nBefore we can store data on this new Stroom node we need to configure it's\nvolumes\nwe have allocated in our Storage hierarchy. The section on adding new volumes in the\nVolume Maintenance HOWTO\nshows how to do this.\nConfigure the Nodes for our Stroom deployment\nIn a Stroom cluster, nodes are expected to communicate with each other on port 8080 over http. Our\ninstallation in a multi node environment ensures the firewall will allow this but we also need to\nconfigure the new node. This is achieved via the Stroom UI where we set a Cluster URL for our node.\nThe section on Configuring a new node in the \nNode Configuration HOWTO demonstrates how do\nset the Cluster URL.\nData Stream Processing\nTo enable Stroom to process data, it's\nStream Processors\nneed to be enabled. There are NOT enabled by default on installation. The following\nsection\nin our Stroom Tasks HowTo shows how to do this.\nTesting our New Node Installation\nTo complete the installation process we will test that our new node has successfully integrated into our cluster.\nFirst we need to ensure we have restarted the Apache Httpd service (httpd.service) on the original nodes so that the new workers.properties\nconfiguration files take effect.\nWe now test the node integration by running the tests we use to validate a Multi Node Stroom Cluster Deployment found\nhere noting we should\nmonitor all three nodes proxy and application log files. Basically we are looking to see that this new node participates in the\nload balancing for the stroomp.strmdev00.org cluster.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallProcessingUserSetupHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallProcessingUserSetupHowTo.html","title":"Processing User Setup","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Processing User Setup\nThis HOWTO demonstrates how to set up various files and scripts that the Stroom processing user requires.\nAssumptions\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills\ninstallation is on a fully patched minimal Centos 7.3 instance.\nthe application user stroomuser has been created\nthe user is deploying for either\nthe example two node Stroom cluster whose storage is described here\na simple Forwarding or Standalone Proxy\nadding a node to an existing Stroom cluster\n\n\n\nSet up the Stroom processing user's environment\nTo automate the running of a Stroom Proxy or Application service under out Stroom processing user, stroomuser, there are a number of configuration files and scripts we need to deploy.\nWe first become the stroomuser\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\n\nEnvironment Variable files\nWhen either a Stroom Proxy or Application starts, it needs predefined environment variables. We set these up in the stroomuser home directory.\nWe need two files for this. The first is for the Stroom processes themselves and the second is for the Stroom systemd service we deploy. The\ndifference is that for the Stroom processes, we need to export the environment variables where as the Stroom systemd service file just needs to read them.\nThe JAVA_HOME and PATH variables are to support Java running the Tomcat instances.\nThe STROOM_TMP variable is set to a working area for the Stroom Application to use. The application accesses this environment variable internally\nvia the ${stroom_tmp} context variable. Note that we only need the STROOM_TMP variable for Stroom Application deployments, so one\ncould remove it from the files for a Forwarding or Standalone proxy deployment.\nWith respect to the working area, we will make use of the Storage Scenario we have defined and hence use the directory /stroomdata/stroom-working-p_nn_ where nn is the hostname node number (i.e 00 for host stroomp00, 01 for host stroomp01, etc).\nSo, for the first node, 00, we run\nN=00\nF=~/env.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export STROOM_TMP=/stroomdata/stroom-working-p%s\\n' ${N} >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nF=~/env_service.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services, executed out of systemd service\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'STROOM_TMP=/stroomdata/stroom-working-p%s\\n' ${N} >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nthen we can change the N variable on each successive node and run the above.\nAlternately, for a Stroom Forwarding or Standalone proxy, the following would be sufficient\nF=~/env.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nF=~/env_service.sh\nprintf '# Environment variables for Stroom services, executed out of systemd service\\n' > ${F}\nprintf 'JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0\\n' >> ${F}\nprintf 'PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\\n' >> ${F}\nchmod 640 ${F}\n\nAnd we integrate the environment into our bash instantiation script as well as setting up useful bash functions.

Irrespective, once the mounting works, make the mounts permanent by adding the following to each node's /etc/fstab file.\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 nfs4 soft,bg\nachieved with\nsudo su -c \"printf 'stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 nfs4 soft,bg\\n' >> /etc/fstab\"\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 nfs4 soft,bg\nachieved with\nsudo su -c \"printf 'stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 nfs4 soft,bg\\n' >> /etc/fstab\"\n\nAt this point reboot all processing nodes to ensure the directories mount automatically. You may need to give the nodes a minute to do this.\nAddition of another Node\nIf one needs to add another node to the cluster, lets say, stroomp02.strmdev00.org, on which /stroomdata follows the same storage hierarchy\nas the existing nodes and all nodes have added mount points (directories) for this new node, you would take the following steps in order.\n\nNode: stroomp02.strmdev00.org\n\nInstall NFS software as above\nConfigure the exports file as per\n\n\n\nsudo su -c \"printf '# Share Stroom data directory\\n' >> /etc/exports\"\nsudo su -c \"printf '/stroomdata\\tstroomp*.strmdev00.org(rw,sync,no_root_squash)\\n' >> /etc/exports\"\n\n\nRestart the NFS service and make the firewall enable NFS access as per\n\nsudo systemctl restart nfs-server\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=nfs --permanent\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all\n\n\nTest mount the existing node file systems\n\nsudo mount -t nfs4 stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00\nsudo mount -t nfs4 stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\n\nOnce the test mounts work, we them permanent by adding the following to the /etc/fstab file.\n\nstroomp00.strmdev00.org:/home/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /home/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 nfs4 soft,bg\nstroomp01.strmdev00.org:/home/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /home/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 nfs4 soft,bg\nachieved with\nsudo su -c \"printf 'stroomp00.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p00 nfs4 soft,bg\\n' >> /etc/fstab\"\nsudo su -c \"printf 'stroomp01.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01 nfs4 soft,bg\\n' >> /etc/fstab\"\n\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org and stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n\nTest mount the new node's filesystem as per\n\n\n\nsudo mount -t nfs4 stroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02\n\n\nOnce the test mount works, make the mount permanent by adding the following to the /etc/fstab file\n\nstroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 nfs4 soft,bg\nachieved with\nsudo su -c \"printf 'stroomp02.strmdev00.org:/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 /stroomdata/stroom-data-p02 nfs4 soft,bg\\n' >> /etc/fstab\"\n\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallTestingHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallTestingHowTo.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Testing Stroom Installation\nThis HOWTO will demonstrate various ways to test that your Stroom installation has been successful.\nAssumptions\n\nStroom Single or Multi Node Cluster Testing\nthe Multi Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application) has been deployed\na Test Feed, TEST-FEED-V1_0 has been added\nProxy aggregation has been turned off on all Stroom Store Proxies\n\n\nStroom Forwarding Proxy Testing\nthe Multi Node Stroom Cluster (Proxy and Application) has been deployed\nthe Stroom Forwarding Proxy has been deployed\na Test Feed, TEST-FEED-V1_0 has been added\n\n\nStroom Standalone Proxy Testing\nthe Stroom Standalone Proxy has been deployed\n\n\n\nStroom Single or Multi Node Cluster Testing\nData Post Tests\nSimple Post tests\nThese tests are to ensure the Stroom Store proxy and it's connection to the database is working along with the Apache mod_jk loadbalancer.\nWe will send a file to the load balanced stroomp.strmdev00.org node (really stroomp00.strmdev00.org) and each time we send the file,\nit's receipt should be managed by alternate proxy nodes.

It has no connectivity to the database, so it assumes all batches are valid, so it stores the batches as files in a configured directory.\n\nForwarding\nA forwarding proxy accepts batches of events, as files.

There should be no errors, but review the output.\nIf you make a mistake in the above, just re-run the script.\nNOTE: The selection of the REPO_DIR above and the setting of the STROOM_TMP environment variable earlier ensure that not only inbound files are placed in the REPO_DIR location but the Stroom Application itself will access the same directory when it aggregates inbound data for ingest in it's proxy aggregation threads.\nForwarding Proxy Configuration\nIn our Forwarding Proxy description below, we will deploy on a host named stroomfp0 and it will store the files\nin /stroomdata/stroom-working-fp0/proxy. Remember, we are being consistent with our Storage hierarchy to make documentation and scripting\nsimpler.

The follow demonstrates adding the volumes for two nodes, but demonstrates the process for a single node\ndeployment as well the volume maintenance needed when expanding a Multi Node Cluster when adding in a new node.\nTo configure the volumes, move to the Tools item of the Main Menu and select it to bring up the Tools sub-menu.\n\nthen move down and select the Volumes sub-item to be presented with the Volumes configuration window as seen below.\n\nThe attributes we see for each volume are\n\nNode - the processing node the volume resides on (this is just the node name entered when configuration the Stroom application)\nPath - the path to the volume\nVolume Type - The type of volume\nPublic - to indicate that all nodes would access this volume\nPrivate - to indicate that only the local node will access this volume\n\n\nStream Status\nActive - to store data within the volume\nInactive - to NOT store data within the volume\nClosed - had stored data within the volume, but now no more data can be stored\n\n\nIndex Status\nActive - to store index data within the volume\nInactive - to NOT store index data within the volume\nClosed - had stored index data within the volume, but now no more index data can be stored\n\n\nUsage Date - the date and time the volume was last used\nLimit - the maximum amount of data the system will store on the volume\nUsed - the amount of data in use on the volume\nFree - the amount of available storage on the volume\nUse% - the usage percentage\n\nIf you are setting up Stroom for the first time and you had accepted the default for the CREATE_DEFAULT_VOLUME_ON_START configuration option (true) when\nconfiguring the Stroom service application, you will see two default volumes have already been created. Had you set this option to false then the window would be empty.\nAdd Volumes\nNow from our two node Stroom Cluster example, our storage hierarchy was\n\nNode: stroomp00.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\nNode: stroomp01.strmdev00.org\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. temporary files, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nFrom this we need to create four volumes. On stroomp00.strmdev00.org we create\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p00       - location to store Stroom application index files\n\nand on stroomp01.strmdev00.org we create\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p01        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p01       - location to store Stroom application index files \n\nSo the first step to configure a volume is to move the cursor to the New icon  in the top left of\nthe Volumes window and select it. This will bring up the Add Volume configuration window\n\nAs you can see, the entry box titles reflect the attributes of a volume. So we will add the first\nnodes data volume\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p00        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\nfor node stroomp00.\n\nIf you move the the Node drop down entry box and select it you will be presented with a choice of available\nnodes - in this case stroomp00 and stroomp01 as we have a two node cluster with these node names.\n\nBy selecting the node stroomp00 we see\n\nTo configure the rest of the attributes for this volume, we:\n\nenter the Path to our first node's data volume\nselect a Volume Type of Public as this is a data volume we want all nodes to access\nselect a Stream Status of Active to indicate we want to store data on it\nselect an Index Status of Inactive as we do NOT want index data stored on it\nset a Limit of 12GB for allowed storage\n\n\nand on selection of the \n\nwe see the changes in the Volumes configuration window\n\nWe next add the first node's index volume, as per\n\nAnd after adding the second node's volumes we are finally presented with our configured volumes\n\nDelete Default Volumes\nWe now need to deal with our default volumes. We want to delete them.\n\nSo we move the cursor to the first volume's line (stroomp00 /home/stroomuser/stroom-app/volumes/defaultindexVolume ...) and select the line then move the cursor to the  Delete icon  in the top left of the Volumes window and select it. On selection you will be given a confirmation request\n\nat which we press the \n\nbutton to see the first default volume has been deleted\n\nand after we select then delete the second default volume( stroomp00 /home/stroomuser/stroom-app/volumes/defaultStreamVolume ...), we are left with\n\nAt this one can close the Volumes configuration window by pressing the \n button.\nNOTE: At the time of writing there is an issue regarding volumes\nStroom Github Issue 84  - https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/84\nDue to Issue 84, if we delete volumes in a multi node environment, the deletion is not propagated to all other nodes in a cluster. Thus if we attempted to use the volumes we would get a database error.\nThe current workaround is to restart all the Stroom applications which will cause a reload of all volume information. This MUST be done before sending any data to your multi-node Stroom cluster.\nAdding new Volumes\nWhen one expands a Multi Node Stroom cluster deployment, after the installation of the Stroom Proxy and Application software and services on the new node,\none has to configure the new volumes that are on the new node. The following demonstrates this assuming we are adding\n\nthe new node is stroomp02\nthe storage hierarchy for this node is\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02     - location to store Stroom application working files (e.g. tmp, output, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-working-p02/proxy       - location for Stroom proxy to store inbound data files\n\n\n\nFrom this we need to create two volumes on stroomp02\n\n/stroomdata/stroom-data-p02        - location to store Stroom application data files (events, etc.) for this node\n/stroomdata/stroom-index-p02       - location to store Stroom application index files\n\nTo configure the volumes, move to the Tools item of the Main Menu and select it to bring up the Tools sub-menu.\n\nthen move down and select the Volumes sub-item to be presented with the Volumes configuration window as. We then move the cursor to\nthe New icon  in the top left of the Volumes window and select it. This will bring up the Add Volume configuration window where we select our volume's node stroomp02.\n\nWe select this node and then configure the rest of the attributes for this data volume\n\nthen press the\n button.\nWe then add another volume for the index volume for this node with attributes as per\n\nAnd on pressing the  button we see our two new volumes for this node have been added.\n\nAt this one can close the Volumes configuration window by pressing the \n button.\n"},"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHttpdHowTo.html":{"url":"HOWTOs/Install/InstallHttpdHowTo.html","title":"Httpd","keywords":"","body":"Stroom HOWTO - Apache Httpd/Mod_JK configuration for Stroom\nThe following is a HOWTO to assist users in configuring Apache's HTTPD with Mod_JK for Stroom.\nAssumptions\nThe following assumptions are used in this document.\n\nthe user has reasonable RHEL/Centos System administration skills\ninstallations are on Centos 7.3 minimal systems (fully patched)\nthe security of the HTTPD deployment should be reviewed for a production environment.\n\nInstallation of Apache httpd and Mod_JK Software\nTo deploy Stroom using Apache's httpd web service as a front end (https) and Apache's mod_jk as the interface between Apache and the Stroom tomcat applications, we also need\n\napr\napr-util\napr-devel\ngcc\nhttpd\nhttpd-devel\nmod_ssl\nepel-release\ntomcat-native\napache's mod_jk tomcat connector plugin\n\nMost of the required software are packages available via standard repositories and hence we can simply execute\nsudo yum -y install apr apr-util apr-devel gcc httpd httpd-devel mod_ssl epel-release\nsudo yum -y install tomcat-native\n\nThe reason for the distinct tomcat-native installation is that this package is from the EPEL repository so it must be installed first.\nFor the Apache mod_jk Tomcat connector we need to acquire a recent\nrelease and install it.\nThe following commands achieve this for the 1.2.42 release.\nsudo bash\ncd /tmp\nV=1.2.42\nwget https://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/tomcat-connectors-${V}-src.tar.gz\ntar xf tomcat-connectors-${V}-src.tar.gz\ncd tomcat-connectors-*-src/native\n./configure --with-apxs=/bin/apxs\nmake && make install\ncd /tmp\nrm -rf tomcat-connectors-*-src\n\nAlthough you could remove the gcc compiler at this point, we leave it installed as one should continue to upgrade the Tomcat Connectors to later releases.\nConfigure Apache httpd\nWe need to configure Apache as the root user.\nIf the Apache httpd service is 'fronting' a Stroom user interface, we should create an index file (/var/www/html/index.html) on all nodes so browsing to\nthe root of the node will present the Stroom UI.

Executing the following will result in two files (workers.properties.stroomp00 and workers.properties.stroomp01) which should be deployed to their respective servers.\ncd /tmp\n# Set the list of nodes\nNodes=\"stroomp00.strmdev00.org stroomp01.strmdev00.org\"\nfor oN in ${Nodes}; do\n  _n=`echo ${oN} | cut -f1 -d\\.`\n  (\n  printf '# Workers.properties for Stroom Cluster member: %s %s\\n' ${oN}\n  printf 'worker.list=loadbalancer,loadbalancer_proxy,local,local_proxy,status\\n'\n  L_t=\"\"\n  Lp_t=\"\"\n  for FQDN in ${Nodes}; do\n    N=`echo ${FQDN} | cut -f1 -d\\.`\n    printf 'worker.%s.port=8009\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s.host=%s\\n' ${N} ${FQDN}\n    printf 'worker.%s.type=ajp13\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s.lbfactor=1\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s.max_packet_size=65536\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s_proxy.port=9009\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s_proxy.host=%s\\n' ${N} ${FQDN}\n    printf 'worker.%s_proxy.type=ajp13\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s_proxy.lbfactor=1\\n' ${N}\n    printf 'worker.%s_proxy.max_packet_size=65536\\n' ${N}\n    L_t=\"${L_t}${N},\"\n    Lp_t=\"${Lp_t}${N}_proxy,\"\n  done\n  L=`echo $L_t | sed -e 's/.$//'`\n  Lp=`echo $Lp_t | sed -e 's/.$//'`\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer.type=lb\\n'\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer.balance_workers=%s\\n' $L\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer.sticky_session=1\\n'\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer_proxy.type=lb\\n'\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer_proxy.balance_workers=%s\\n' $Lp\n  printf 'worker.loadbalancer_proxy.sticky_session=1\\n'\n  printf 'worker.local.type=lb\\n'\n  printf 'worker.local.balance_workers=%s\\n' ${_n}\n  printf 'worker.local.sticky_session=1\\n'\n  printf 'worker.local_proxy.type=lb\\n'\n  printf 'worker.local_proxy.balance_workers=%s_proxy\\n' ${_n}\n  printf 'worker.local_proxy.sticky_session=1\\n'\n  printf 'worker.status.type=status\\n'\n  ) > workers.properties.${_n}\n  chmod 640 workers.properties.${_n}\ndone\n\nNow depending in the node you are on, copy the relevant workers.properties.nodename file to /etc/httpd/conf/workers.properties. The following command makes this simple.\ncp workers.properties.`hostname -s` /etc/httpd/conf/workers.properties\n\nIf you were to add an additional node to a multi node cluster, say the node stroomp02.strmdev00.org, then you would re-run the above script with\nNodes=\"stroomp00.strmdev00.org stroomp01.strmdev00.org stroomp02.strmdev00.org\"\n\nthen redeploy all three files to the respective servers. Also note, that for the newly created workers.properties files for the existing nodes to\ntake effect you will need to restart the Apache Httpd service on both nodes.\nRemember, in multi node cluster deployments, the following files are the same and hence can be created on one node, but copied to the\nothers not forgetting to backup the other node's original files. That is, the files\n\n/var/www/html/index.html\n/etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_jk.conf\n/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n\nare to be the same on all nodes.

This excludes enter/return presses.\n\n\nCreate certificates\nThe first step is to establish a self signed certificate for our Stroom service. If you have a certificate server, then certainly gain an\nappropriately signed certificate. For this HOWTO, we will stay with a self signed solution and hence no certificate authorities are\ninvolved. If you are deploying a cluster, then you will only have one certificate for all nodes. We achieve this by setting up an\nalias for the first node in the cluster and then use that alias for addressing the cluster. That is, we have set up a\nCNAME, stroomp.strmdev00.org for stroomp00.strmdev00.org. This means within the web service we deploy, the ServerName will be stroomp.strmdev00.org\non each node. Since it's one certificate we only need to set it up on one node then deploy the certificate key files to other nodes.\nAs the certificates will be stored in the stroomuser's home directory, we become the stroom user\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\n\n\nTo make things simpler in the following bash extracts, we establish the bash variable H to be used in filename generation. The variable name\nis set to the name of the host (or cluster alias) your are deploying the certificates on. In our multi node HOWTO example we are using, we\nwould use the host CNAME stroomp.  Thus we execute\nexport H=stroomp\n\nNote in our the Stroom Forwarding Proxy HOWTO we would use the name stroomfp0. In the case of our Standalone Proxy we would use stroomsap0.\nWe set up a directory to house our certificates via\ncd ~stroomuser\nrm -rf stroom-jks\nmkdir -p stroom-jks stroom-jks/public stroom-jks/private\ncd stroom-jks\n\nCreate a server key for Stroom service (enter a password when prompted for both initial and verification prompts)\nopenssl genrsa -des3 -out private/$H.key 2048\n\nas per\nGenerating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus\n.................................................................+++\n...............................................+++\ne is 65537 (0x10001)\nEnter pass phrase for private/stroomp.key: \nVerifying - Enter pass phrase for private/stroomp.key: \nCreate a signing request.

That is,\ntar it up, copy the tar file to the other node(s) then untar it. We can make use of the other node's mounted file system for this process.\nThat is one could execute the commands on the first node, where we created the certificates\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar cf stroom-jks.tar stroom-jks\nmv stroom-jks.tar /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01\n\nthen on the another node, say stroomp01.strmdev00.org, as the stroomuser we extract the data.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\ncd ~stroomuser\ntar xf /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01/stroom-jks.tar && rm -f /stroomdata/stroom-data-p01/stroom-jks.tar\n\nProtection, Ownership and SELinux Context\nNow ensure protection, ownership and SELinux context for these key files on ALL_ nodes via\nchmod 700 ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/private ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchown -R stroomuser:stroomuser ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nchcon -R --reference /etc/pki ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\n\nStroom Proxy to Proxy Key and Trust Stores\nIn order for a Stroom Forwarding Proxy to communicate to a central Stroom proxy over https, the JVM running the forwarding proxy needs\nrelevant keystores set up.\nOne would set up a Stroom's forwarding proxy SSL certificate as per above, with the change that the\nhostname would be different. That is, in the initial setup, we would set the hostname variable H to be the hostname of the forwarding\nproxy. Lets say it is stroomfp0 thus we would set\nexport H=stroomfp0\n\nand then proceed as above.\nNote that you also need the public key of the central Stroom server you will be connecting to. For the following, we will assume\nthe central Stroom proxy is the stroomp.strmdev00.org server and it's public key is stored in the file stroomp.crt. We will store\nthis file on the forwarding proxy in ~stroomuser/stroom-jks/public/stroomp.crt.\nSo once you have created the forwarding proxy server's SSL keys and have deployed the central proxy's public key, we next\nneed to convert the proxy server's SSL keys into DER format. This is done by executing the following.\ncd ~stroomuser/stroom-jks\nexport H=stroomfp0\nexport S=stroomp\nrm -f ${H}_k.jks ${S}_t.jks\nH_k=${H}\nS_k=${S}\n# Convert public key\nopenssl x509 -in public/$H.crt -inform PERM -out public/$H.crt.der -outform DER\n\nWhen you convert the local server's private key, you will be prompted for the server key password. \n# Convert the local server's Private key\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in private/$H.key.secure -inform PEM -out private/$H.key.der -outform DER\n\nas per\nEnter pass phrase for private/stroomfp0.key.secure: \nWe now import these keys into our Key Store. As part of the Stroom Proxy release, an Import Keystore application has been provisioned. We identify where it's found with the command\nfind ~stroomuser/*proxy -name 'stroom-util*.jar' -print | head -1\n\nwhich should return /home/stroomuser/stroom-proxy/instance/webapps/stroom/WEB-INF/lib/stroom-util-5.0.beta1-SNAPSHOT.jar or similar depending on the release version.\nTo make execution simpler, we set this as a shell variable as per\nStroom_UTIL_JAR=`find ~/*proxy -name 'stroom-util*.jar' -print | head -1`\n\nWe now create the keystore and import the proxy's server key\njava -cp ${Stroom_UTIL_JAR} stroom.util.cert.ImportKey keystore=${H}_k.jks keypass=$H alias=$H keyfile=private/$H.key.der certfile=public/$H.crt.der\n\nas per\nOne certificate, no chain\nWe now import the destination server's public key\nkeytool -import -noprompt -alias ${S} -file public/${S}.crt -keystore ${S}_k.jks -storepass ${S}\n\nas per\nCertificate was added to keystore\nWe now add the key and trust store location and password arguments to our Stroom proxy environment files.\nPWD=`pwd`\necho \"export JAVA_OPTS=\\\"-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${PWD}/${S}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=${S} -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${PWD}/${H}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=${H}\\\"\" >> ~/env.sh\necho \"JAVA_OPTS=\\\"-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${PWD}/${S}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=${S} -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${PWD}/${H}_k.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=${H}\\\"\" >> ~/env_service.sh\n\nAt this point you should restart the proxy service.

You should regularly monitor the site for newer releases.\nsudo -i -u stroomuser\nApp=5.0-beta.18\nwget https://github.com/gchq/stroom/releases/download/v${App}/stroom-app-distribution-${App}-bin.zip\nunzip stroom-app-distribution-${App}-bin.zip\nchmod 750 stroom-app\n\nConfigure the Software\nWe install the application via\nstroom-app/bin/setup.sh\n\nduring which one is prompted for a number of configuration settings. Use the following\nTEMP_DIR should be set to '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p00' or '/stroomdata/stroom-working-p01' etc depending on the node we are installing on\nNODE to be the hostname (not FQDN) of your host (i.e. 'stroomp00' or 'stroomp01' in our multi node scenario)\nRACK can be ignored, just press return\nPORT_PREFIX should use the default, just press return\nJDBC_CLASSNAME should use the default, just press return\nJDBC_URL to 'jdbc:mysql://stroomdb0.strmdev00.org:3307/stroom?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8'\nDB_USERNAME should be our processing user, 'stroomuser'\nDB_PASSWORD should be the one we set when creating the stroom database, that is 'Stroompassword1@'\nJPA_DIALECT should use the default, just press return\nJAVA_OPTS can use the defaults, but ensure you have sufficient memory, either change or accept the default\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC_CLASSNAME should use the default, just press return\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_JDBC_URL to 'jdbc:mysql://stroomdb0.strmdev00.org:3308/statistics?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8'\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB_USERNAME should be our processing user, 'stroomstats'\nSTROOM_STATISTICS_SQL_DB_PASSWORD should be the one we set when creating the stroom database, that is 'Stroompassword2@'\nSTATS_ENGINES should use the default, just press return\nCONTENT_PACK_IMPORT_ENABLED should use the default, just press return\nCREATE_DEFAULT_VOLUME_ON_START should use the default, just press return\nAt this point, the script will configure the application. There should be no errors, but review the output.\nIf you made an error then just re-run the script.\nYou will note that TEMP_DIR is the same directory we used for our STROOM_TMP environment variable when we set up the processing user scripts.\nNote that if you are deploying a single node environment, where the database is also running on your Stroom node, then the JDBC_URL setting can be the default.\nStart the Application service\nNow we start the application. In the case of multi node Stroom deployment, we start the Stroom application on the first node in the cluster,\nthen wait until it has initialised the database commenced it's Lifecycle task. You will need to monitor the log file to see it's\ncompleted initialisation.\nSo as the stroomuser start the application with the command\nstroom-app/bin/start.sh\n\nNow monitor stroom-app/instance/logs for any errors. Initially you will see the log files localhost_access_log.YYYY-MM-DD.txt\nand catalina.out. Check them for errors and correct (or post a question). The log4j warnings in catalina.out can be ignored.\nEventually the log file stroom-app/instance/logs/stroom.log will appear. Again check it for errors and then wait for the application to\nbe initialised. That is, wait for the Lifecycle service thread to start. This is indicated by the message\nINFO  [Thread-11] lifecycle.LifecycleServiceImpl (LifecycleServiceImpl.java:166) - Started Stroom Lifecycle service\nThe directory stroom-app/instance/logs/events will also appear with an empty file with\nthe nomenclature events_YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msecZ. This is the directory for storing Stroom's application event logs. We will return to this\ndirectory and it's content in a later HOWTO.\nIf you have a multi node configuration, then once the database has initialised, start the application service on all other nodes. Again with\nstroom-app/bin/start.sh\n\nand then monitor the files in its stroom-app/instance/logs for any errors. Note that in multi node configurations,\nyou will see server.UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler messages in the log file of the form\nWARN  [Stroom P2 #9 - GenericServerTask] server.UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler (UpdateClusterStateTaskHandler.java:150) - discover() - unable to contact stroomp00 - No cluster call URL has been set for node: stroomp00\nThis is ok as we will establish the cluster URL's later.\nMulti Node Firewall Provision\nIn the case of a multi node Stroom deployment, you will need to open certain ports to allow Tomcat to communicate to all nodes participating\nin the cluster.

This is a guide for running Stroom in IntelliJ for the purposes of developing/debugging Stroom.\nPrerequisites\nIn order to build/run/debug Stroom you will need the following:\n\nJava 8 JDK\nGit\nGradle\nIntelliJ\nA MySQL database server v5.5 (either installed directly or inside a Docker container)\n\nClone and build event-logging\nStroom is dependant on the event-logging project as this is used internally for generating audit events for activity in Stroom. Until event-logging is released to a public Maven repository you must first clone and build event-logging.\ngit clone https:///scm/stroom/event-logging.git\ncd event-logging\nmvn clean install\n\nEnvironment variables\nStroom relies on the environment variable STROOM_TMP to tell it which directory to use for its temporary files.  In development this is also the location used by the stream store. In the absence of STROOM_TMP Stroom falls back on the Java system property java.io.tmpdir.\nYou are recommended to set STROOM_TMP in your .bashrc / .zshrc file by adding like the following:\nexport STROOM_TMP=/home/developer/tmp/stroom/\n\nDatabase setup\nStroom requires a MySQL database to run. You can either point stroom at a MySQL server or at a MySQL Docker container\nMySQL in a Docker container\nTo configure the stroom database in a MySQL Docker container see Running Stroom using Docker for how to set this up.\nHost based MySQL server\nWith an instance of MySQL server 5.5 running on your local machine do the following to create the stroom database:\n# log into your MySQL server using your root credentials\nmysql --user=root --password=myrootpassword\n\nThen run the following commands in the MySQL shell:\ndrop database stroom;\ncreate database stroom;\ngrant all privileges on stroom.* to stroomuser@localhost identified by 'stroompassword1';\nquit;\n\nLocal configuration file\nStroom comes with a default configuration file but it is wise to set up your own local file to allow you to run with your own environment specific settings.\nThe default property file can be found in \nstroom-config/src/main/resources/stroom.properties\nCreate the your local configuration file and directory:\nmkdir -p ~/.stroom/\ntouch stroom.conf\n\nAdd any properties from stroom.properties that you want different values for, e.g.\n#Uncomment this to enable browser's right click menu for development\n#stroom.ui.oncontextmenu=\n\n#Connect to MySQL in Docker\nstroom.jdbcDriverUrl=jdbc:mysql://172.17.0.2/stroom?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8\nstroom.jdbcDriverUsername=myOtherUser\nstroom.jdbcDriverPassword=myOtherPassword\n\nVerify the Gradle build\nBefore trying to run Stroom in an IDE it is worth performing a Gradle build without all the tests to verify the code compiles.\nStroom is dependant on the event-logging repo for its build. Utill event-logging has been added to Maven Central you need to clone and build this first. So in your chosen directory for git repositories do:\ngit clone git@github.com:gchq/event-logging.git\ncd event-logging\nmvn clean install\n\nOnce event-logging has built successfully it will exist in you local Maven repository so you can now build Stroom, skipping the tests and the GWT compilation.\ngradle clean build -x test -PskipGWT\n\nSample Data\nSome of the tests are dependant on some sample data and content being present in the database.  This sample data/content is also useful for manually testing the application in development. The sample data/content is generated by a class called SetupSampleData.java. This class assumes that the database being used for Stroom is completely empty.\nFirst you need to create a run configuration for SetupSampleData.java\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main Class field enter SetupSampleData\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-integrationtest\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run SetupSampleData \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect SetupSampleData\n\nYou should now have a database populated with tables and data, providing you with some predefined feeds, data, translations, pipelines, dashboards, etc.\nRunning Stroom from the IDE\nThe user interface for Stroom is built using GWT (see GWT Project for more information or GWT specific documentation). As a result Stroom needs to be started up with GWT Dev Mode. Dev Mode handles the compilation of the Java user interface source into JavaScript and the source map that links client JavaScript back to Java source for client side debugging.\nStroom is run from the main method in Startup.java. Before running this you need to setup the run configuration:\n\nClick Run -> Edit Configurations...\nClick the green + icon to add a new configuration\nSelect Application as the configuration type\nIn the Main class field enter Startup\nIn the Programme arguments field enter \n-startupUrl stroom.jsp -logLevel INFO -war . -logdir . -gen . -extra . -workDir . stroom.app.AppSuperDevMode\n\nIn the Use classpath of module field select stroom-startup\n\nIf you have set the STROOM_TMP environment variable in your .bashrc / .zshrc then ignore this step.  In the Environment variables field click the ... icon and add STROOM_TMP = ~/tmp/stroom/ (or whatever directory you choose)\nClick the OK button\n\nNow run Startup \n\nClick Run -> Run...\nSelect Startup\n\nYou should eventually see the GWT Dev Mode window appear.\n\nInitially, some of the buttons shown above will not be visible as it is in the process of starting up. As soon as the Launch Default Browser button appears you are ready to open Stroom in a browser. You have two options:\n\nClick the Launch Default Browser button\nOpen your preferred browser and enter the URL http://127.0.0.1:8888\n\n\nNOTE: Stroom has been written with Google's Chrome browser in mind so has only been tested on Chrome. Behaviour in other browsers may vary. We would like to improve cross-browser support so please let us know about any browser incompatibilities that you find.\n\nIn the browser you will initially see the following:\n\nStarting Stroom\nInitialising context...\n\nOnce the context has been initialised you will see the Stroom blue background and a spinner while GWT compiles the front-end code. Once the code has been compiled you will be presented with the Stroom login page. Stroom in development mode uses simple username/password authentication. Enter the following credentials:\n\nUsername: admin\nPassword: admin\n\nRight click behaviour\nStroom overrides the defualt right click behaviour in the browser with its own context menu.
